# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenge
This is my submission for the Week 1 Homework of the Bootcamp where we had to improve the accessibility standards of the website by including alt tags on images and replacing the default HTML tags with semantic HTML tags that clearly describe the structure and what code relates to which tags. The User Story and Acceptance Criteria was what needed to be followed as per below.


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## End Result
